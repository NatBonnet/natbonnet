🔭 Current work
I am a Master's of Environmental Data Science student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. I am also currently working as a data science intern at the National Center for Environmental Analysis and Synthesis. 

🌱 My interests
I have a background in pollinator climate resilience, and am interested in continuing researching the intersection between pollinator conservation and food security. My previous experiences have also fueled interest in disease entomology and the field as it relates to climate change.
